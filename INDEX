Cramer-Test as R-Function (Version 0.2; Apr 2001)
======================================================

This is an attempt to implement the new Cramer-Two-Sample-
Test as an R-Library. Univariate as well as multi-variate 
data is supported. The library 'boot' from Angelo Canty is 
required since the test is heavily based on bootstrap 
critical values.

The library contains the following functions, both of which
have online help available.

cramer.test       main test function
print.cramertest  prints summary of test result

As well as these functions the following function is 
included. This function is not intended to be used alone 
but is used by the above functions. 

cramer.statistic  evaluates statistic, required for
                  bootstrap 
		  
The following class is introduced to store test summaries

cramertest

The Cramer-Test is based on an idea of L. Baringhaus, 
University of Hanover, and its properties are discussed in

L.Baringhaus, C.Franz, "On a new multivariate two-sample
   test", submitted, 2001

   Zweistichproben-Problem", German, Diploma Thesis,
